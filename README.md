# Behind the Scenes

Throughout early August 2016, I worked on renovating this Android application as part of completing the [Material Design for Android Developers]() course at [Udacity](). During the time I spent on this project, I was tasked to:

* Utilize the Android Design Support library and its components to enhance the user UI experience.
* Implement parallax scrolling via the use of a `CollapsingToolbarLayout` and a `CoordinatorLayout` in the main activity.
* Integrate the use of a `FloatingActionButton` for the most commonly used user action.
* Create an attractive and elegant color scheme for the UI.
* Provide valid material design dimensions for layout XML values such as elevation, padding, margins, and more.
* Ensure that the images loaded by the Views were properly cropped and scaled.
* Test that the design scales gracefully across a wide range of devices and is adaptive to both mobile and tablet UIs.

I believe I achieved all of these and more, while preserving almost all of the original business logic. 

When I first started to work on this project, this was my starting point:
