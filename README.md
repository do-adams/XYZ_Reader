# Behind the Scenes

Throughout early August 2016, I worked on renovating this Android application as part of completing the [Material Design for Android Developers](https://www.udacity.com/course/material-design-for-android-developers--ud862) course at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/). During the time I spent on this project, I essentially managed to:

* Utilize the Android Design Support library and its components to enhance the user UI experience.
* Implement parallax scrolling via the use of a `CollapsingToolbarLayout` and a `CoordinatorLayout` in the main activity.
* Integrate the use of a `FloatingActionButton` for the most commonly used user action.
* Create an attractive and elegant color scheme for the UI.
* Provide valid material design dimensions for layout XML values such as elevation, padding, margins, and more.
* Align text and UI elements in a way that takes advantage of the Gestalt principles of grouping.
* Ensure that the images loaded by the views are properly cropped and scaled and that the text is readable and pleasing to the eye. 
* Test that the design scales gracefully across a wide range of devices and is adaptive to both mobile and tablet UIs.

When I first started to work on this project, this was my starting point:
